 Generate an image based on a given string, where the most frequent words appear larger in the image and the least frequent words appear smaller. If running on jupyter notebook, uncomment the upload funtion and comment the page string, if running locally keep the upload function commented out and insert your text into the page variable. Then run in terminal.


 Currently doesnt keep track of words with any punctuation in them, will fix later.
